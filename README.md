# pico-nn

A package containing implementations for different nerual networks algorithms made mainly for the purpose of learning.

## TODOs:

- Setup as an actual package.
- Refine the API for the FCNN algorithm. For example, supporting multiple activation functions, providing better input API, and other.
- Add more models.
